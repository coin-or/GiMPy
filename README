GiMPy 1.0
=========

Graph Methods in Python (GiMPy) is a Python graph library containing pure
Python implementations of a variety of graph algorithms. The goal is clarity
in implementation rather than eficiency. Most methods have an accompanying
visualization and are thus appropriate for use in the classroom.
